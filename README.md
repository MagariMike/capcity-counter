# Venue Capacity Counter App ðŸŽ¸

This app came about as i studied music for many years and still play in bands regularly. I noticed that many venues still provide manual "clicker" style counters for door staff to use to make sure the venues capacity is not exceeded. That led me to build this app which digitizes this in a much more user friendly way using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
